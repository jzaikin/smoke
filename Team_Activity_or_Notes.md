More info on environment variables:

I've found that you can pass env. variables through Docker on the compose.yml file, by creating a .env file 
and with VAR=VAL then on the compose file, you can add environment section and list the variables under. However,
I think our main issue is setting & getting the NODE environment variable. I found out that the config/index is bundled
through webpack. I've tried to add in an environment variable to the .env.dev file but it won't compose correctly, there's
still something that is missing. I'll read more into webpack and see what needs to be declared in the wepback config.
